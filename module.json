A weapon with the multigrip trait can be wielded in different orientations, allowing it to serve different purposes while dealing the same damage. Its entry lists a set of weapon traits associated with these different grips. When you draw a multigrip weapon, choose one of the listed traits. The weapon gains this trait until you Release the weapon or Interact to choose a different trait. During this Interact action, you can also change the number of hands you’re holding the weapon with. Property runes that require a specific weapon trait can be etched onto a multigrip weapon with the required trait listed under its multigrip entry, but the rune’s effects are suppressed when that trait is not active."
